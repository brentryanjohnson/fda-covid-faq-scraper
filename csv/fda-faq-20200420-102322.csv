Q: What is a novel coronavirus?,"<div>
<p>A: A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: What is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?,"<div>
<p>A: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. There are many types of human coronaviruses, including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: How can I prevent COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases.</p>

Q: Should I wear a face covering or face mask when I go out in public?,"<div>
<p>A: CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html"">recommends wearing cloth face coverings</a> in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus.  The purpose of wearing cloth face coverings in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.<br/></p></div>"
Q: What treatments are available for COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. </p>
<p>Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html"">more information for health care providers</a> about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Can disinfectant sprays or wipes be used on my skin to prevent spread of COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: No. Always follow the instructions on household cleaners. Do not use disinfect sprays or wipes on your skin because it may cause skin and eye irritation. Disinfectant sprays or wipes are not intended for use on humans or animals. Disinfectant sprays or wipes are intended for use on hard, non-porous surfaces.</p>

<p>
</p></div>"
Q. Is hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A. The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/"">advises the CDC</a>. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. </p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q. Where can I buy hand sanitizer? If I can’t find it in the store, can I make my own?","<div>
<p>A. Many retail stores and pharmacies sell hand sanitizers. However, we understand that many stores have run out of hand sanitizers and they may be difficult to find. To help increase the availability of hand sanitizers, the FDA has issued guidance for the temporary preparation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers by some companies and pharmacies during the public health emergency posed by COVID-19. </p>
<p>The FDA does not recommend that consumers make their own hand sanitizer. If made incorrectly, hand sanitizer can be ineffective, and there have been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer. The agency lacks verifiable information on the methods being used to prepare hand sanitizer at home and whether they are safe for use on human skin.</p>

Q: What is a biological medical product or a biologic?,"<div>
<p>A: Biological products include a wide range of products such as vaccines, blood and blood components, allergenics, somatic cells, gene therapy, tissues, and recombinant therapeutic proteins. Biologics can be composed of sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids or complex combinations of these substances, or may be living entities such as cells and tissues.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Are there any vaccines or other medical products to prevent COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: At this time there is no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The FDA is working with vaccine developers and other researchers and manufacturers to help expedite the development and availability of medical products such as vaccines, antibodies, and drugs to prevent COVID-19. <a href=""/emergency-preparedness-and-response/counterterrorism-and-emerging-threats/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19"">Read more</a> about what FDA is doing to mitigate the effects of COVID-19.</p>

Q: Does COVID-19 present a risk to the safety of the nation’s blood supply?,"<div>
<p>A: In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion, and there have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q: Can SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, be transmitted by blood transfusion?","<div>
			 

<p>A: In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion, and there have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q: What steps are being taken to protect the U.S. blood supply from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?","<div>
			 

<p>A: Blood donors must be healthy and feel well on the day of donation. Routine blood donor screening measures that are already in place should prevent individuals with respiratory infections from donating blood. For example, blood donors must be in good health and have a normal temperature on the day of donation.</p>
<p>Donors are instructed to contact the donor center if they become ill after donation, so that their blood or plasma will not be used. Even when a donor develops COVID-19 after donation, however, there have been no cases of COVID-19 linked to donor blood or products made from blood.   </p>
<p>FDA has provided <a href=""/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/important-information-blood-establishments-regarding-novel-coronavirus-outbreak"">additional information to blood establishments</a> on its website. </p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Why aren’t blood centers testing donors for SARS-CoV-2?,"<div>
			 

<p>A:  At this time, the FDA does not recommend using laboratory tests to screen blood. Someone who has symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath, is not healthy enough to donate blood. Standard screening processes already in place will mean that someone with these symptoms will not be allowed to donate. </p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Is it safe for me to donate blood during the coronavirus pandemic?,"<div>
			 

<p>A: If you are healthy and interested in donating blood, the FDA encourages you to contact a local donation center to make an appointment. One way to make a difference during a public health emergency is to donate blood if you are able. </p>

"Q: Can COVID-19 be transmitted through human cells, tissues, or cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps)?","<div>
<p>A: Respiratory viruses, in general, are not known to be transmitted by implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer of human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps). The potential for transmission of COVID-19 by HCT/Ps is unknown at this time. There have been no reported cases of transmission of COVID-19 via HCT/Ps.</p>
<p>Routine screening measures are already in place for evaluating clinical evidence of infection in HCT/P donors. <a href=""/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/important-information-human-cell-tissue-or-cellular-or-tissue-based-product-hctp-establishments"">Read more…</a></p>

Q: What is convalescent plasma and why is it being investigated to treat COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients develop antibodies in the blood against the virus. Antibodies are proteins  that might help fight the infection. Convalescent plasma is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is no approved treatment for this disease and there is some information that suggests it might help some patients recover from COVID-19. Further investigation is still necessary to determine if convalescent plasma might shorten the duration of illness, reduce morbidity, or prevent death associated with COVID-19.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q: I recently recovered from COVID-19, can I donate convalescent plasma? ","<div>
			   

<p>A: COVID-19 convalescent plasma must only be collected from recovered individuals if they are eligible to donate blood. Individuals must have had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a laboratory test and meet other laboratory criteria. Individuals must have fully recovered from COVID-19, with complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days before donation of convalescent plasma. You can ask your local blood center if there are options to donate convalescent plasma in your area.

<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. Antibiotics do not prevent or treat coronavirus disease (COVID-19), because COVID-19 is caused by a virus, not bacteria. Some patients with COVID-19 may also develop a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia. In that case, a health care professional may treat the bacterial infection with an antibiotic.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q. Will Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) cure COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A:  No. Miracle Mineral Solution does not cure COVID-19 and has not been approved by the FDA for any use. The solution, when mixed, develops into a dangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. For more information, see: <a href=""/news-events/press-announcements/fda-warns-consumers-about-dangerous-and-potentially-life-threatening-side-effects-miracle-mineral"">FDA warns consumers about the dangerous and potentially life threatening side effects of Miracle Mineral Solution</a> and <a href=""/consumers/consumer-updates/danger-dont-drink-miracle-mineral-solution-or-similar-products"">Danger: Don’t Drink Miracle Mineral Solution or Similar Products</a>. </p>

Q: Are chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: No. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and some versions of chloroquine phosphate are FDA-approved to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is also FDA-approved to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. <a href=""/media/136784/download"">Read more about the emergency use authorization for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate for COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: May health care providers prescribe chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate off-label to treat patients with COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: As mentioned above, chloroquine phosphate is only approved for the treatment of malaria, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate is only approved for the treatment of malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Once FDA has approved a drug, healthcare providers generally may prescribe or administer the drug for an unapproved use, including in clinical settings not described in the approved labeling. This decision will be based on their assessment of the potential benefits versus the risks for their patient, recognizing that FDA has not assessed the safety or effectiveness of such use.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Are there data showing that chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate might benefit patients with COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control).</p>
<p>Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covidtherapeutics"">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020</a>.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q. Is the chloroquine phosphate used to treat disease in aquarium fish the same as the chloroquine phosphate that FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for as a COVID-19 treatment for humans?,"<div>
<p>A. No. Products marketed for veterinary use, “for research only,” or otherwise not for human consumption have not been evaluated for safety or effectiveness and <strong>should never be used by humans</strong>. FDA is aware that chloroquine phosphate is marketed to treat disease in aquarium fish, but these products have not been evaluated by FDA to determine if they are safe, effective, properly manufactured, and adequately labeled. The agency continues to work with online marketplaces to remove these items, and many have been removed based on these efforts. Patients should not take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a licensed health care provider. Chloroquine products also should not be given to pets or livestock unless prescribed by a veterinarian. </p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Should I take ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: No. While there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. You should not take any medicine to treat or prevent COVID-19 unless it has been prescribed to you by your health care provider and acquired from a legitimate source. </p>
<p>A recently released <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011"">research article</a> described the effect of ivermectin on SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory setting. These types of laboratory studies are commonly used at an early stage of drug development. Additional testing is needed to determine whether ivermectin might be appropriate to prevent or treat coronavirus or COVID-19. <a href=""/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/faq-covid-19-and-ivermectin-intended-animals"">Read more about ivermectin</a>.</p>

Q: What is the FDA doing to protect people from fraudulent COVID-19 products?,"<div>
<p>A: We have established a cross-agency task force dedicated to closely monitoring for fraudulent COVID-19 products. We have reached out to major retailers to ask for their help in monitoring online marketplaces for fraudulent COVID-19 products. Products sold are subject to FDA investigation and potential enforcement action if they claim to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure COVID-19 and have not demonstrated safety and effectiveness for that intended use. The task force has already worked with retailers to remove dozens of these types of product listings online. </p>
<p>The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issue warning letters to companies that violate federal law and pose significant risks to patient health by selling unapproved products with fraudulent claims to treat or prevent COVID-19. <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products#Warning%20Letter%20Table"">View the warning letters</a> for more information.</p>

<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Is there a test for COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: Currently there is no FDA-approved or cleared test to diagnose or detect COVID-19 because the virus that causes COVID-19 is new. Therefore, the FDA has issued several Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for the use of new diagnostic tests to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. During public health emergencies declared under section 564 of the FD&amp;C Act, the FDA is able to issue EUAs when certain criteria are met that allows for the use and distribution of potentially life-saving medical products to diagnose, treat, or prevent the disease, which can include diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q. How are people tested for COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A. To be tested for COVID-19, a sample is typically collected from your nose and/or throat with a special swab at a designated collection location staffed by health care professionals. Currently, a health care professional swabbing the back of the nasal cavity through the nostril is the preferred choice. Alternatively, the health care professional could may swab the back of your throat, or for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 the sample could may be collected by swabbing the inside of the front of the nose. Depending on, among other things, the type of swab used, a health care professional may collect the sample, or you may be able to collect the sample yourself at the collection site under the supervision of health care personnel.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Are there any tests that I can purchase to test myself at home for COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: At this time, the FDA has not authorized any test that is available to purchase for testing yourself at home for COVID-19. The FDA sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection, and we are actively working with test developers on this goal. You can find <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2#offeringtests"">listings of tests</a> that have received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as well as labs and manufacturers that have notified FDA as set forth in the FDA's <a href=""/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policy-diagnostic-tests-coronavirus-disease-2019-during-public-health-emergency"">Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019</a>.</p>

Q: Should I purchase personal protective equipment such as facemasks or N95 respirators for me and my family? ,"<div>
<p>A: No. <a href=""/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks"">Surgical masks and N95s</a> need to be reserved for use by healthcare workers, first responders, and other frontline workers whose jobs put them at much greater risk of acquiring COVID-19. The cloth face coverings recommended by CDC are not surgical masks or N95 respirators. Surgical masks and N95s  are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by CDC.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q: Is there a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and N95 respirators or of ventilators?","<div>
<p>A:  The FDA has been working closely with PPE and ventilator manufacturers to understand their supply capabilities during this pandemic. The agency is also aware of challenges throughout the supply chain that are presently impacting the availability of PPE products and is taking steps to mitigate shortages that health care facilities are already experiencing. </p>

Q. Can 3D printing be used to make PPE?,"<div>
<p>A. Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes protective clothing, gowns, gloves, face shields, goggles, face masks, and respirators or other equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness. While it is possible to use 3D printing to make certain PPE, there are technical challenges. 3D-printed PPE may provide a physical barrier, but 3D-printed PPE are unlikely to provide the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection as FDA-cleared surgical masks and N95 respirators.

Q: Are food products produced in the United States or other countries affected by COVID-19 a risk for the spread of COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: There is no evidence to suggest that food produced in the United States or imported from countries affected by COVID-19 can transmit COVID-19.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q: Can I get the coronavirus from food, food packaging, or food containers and preparation area?","<div>
<p>A: Currently there is no evidence of food, food containers, or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.  Like other viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects. For that reason, it is critical to follow the 4 key steps of food safety—<a href=""https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep-food-safe/4-steps-to-food-safety"">clean, separate, cook, and chill</a>. </p>
<p>If you are concerned about contamination of food or food packaging, wash your hands after handling food packaging, after removing food from the packaging, before you prepare food for eating and before you eat. Consumers can follow <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/"">CDC guidelines on frequent hand washing</a> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; and frequent cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q:  Is the U.S. food supply safe?,"<div>
<p>A: Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.   </p>
<p>Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness and not gastrointestinal illness, and foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.</p>
<p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. That’s why it’s always critical to follow the 4 key steps of food safety—<a href=""https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep-food-safe/4-steps-to-food-safety"">clean, separate, cook, and chill</a>.</p>

</p></div>"
Q: Can I get COVID-19 from a food worker handling my food?,"<div>
<p>A: Currently, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19. However, the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person in some communities in the U.S. The CDC recommends that if you are sick, stay home until you are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. </p>
<p>Anyone handling, preparing and serving food should always follow <a href=""/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/safe-food-handling"">safe food handling procedures</a>, such as washing hands and surfaces often.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Should food workers who are ill stay home? ,"<div>
<p>A: CDC recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4° F [37.8° C] or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants). Employees should notify their supervisor and stay home if they are sick. We recommend that businesses review <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fguidance-business-response.html"">CDC’s interim guidance for businesses and employers</a> for planning and responding to coronavirus disease.  Also see the FDA’s <a href=""/food/retail-food-industryregulatory-assistance-training/retail-food-protection-employee-health-and-personal-hygiene-handbook"">Retail Food Protection: Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Handbook</a>.</p>

Q: Can I get COVID-19 from my pet or other animals?,"<div>
<p>A: There is currently no evidence that animals are a source of COVID-19 infection in the United States.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q: Is there a test for COVID-19 in pets? If so, has it been approved by FDA?","<div>
<p>A: Certain private, state, and university veterinary diagnostic laboratories have developed diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for use in dogs and cats. The decision to test pets should be made collaboratively between local, state, or federal public and animal health officials.</p>
<p>Although FDA approval is not required prior to such tests being made commercially available for use in animals, the FDA is aware of at least two private diagnostic laboratories that have developed COVID-19 tests for pets. While FDA has not formally evaluated these tests, the agency has been in contact with these laboratories to gather information about their development and validation.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Should I get my pet tested for COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: Routine testing of pets for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time. There is currently no evidence that animals are a source of COVID-19 infection in the United States.</p>
<p>The decision to test individual pets in certain circumstances would include consultation between the involved veterinarian and appropriate local, state, and federal public health and animal health officials. At this time, testing for COVID-19 would be focused on situations involving clinically ill pets, who have had close contact with a COVID-19-positive person and where other, more-likely diagnoses have been ruled out with appropriate diagnostic testing. </p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: What animal species can get COVID-19?,"<div>
<p>A: We currently don’t fully understand how COVID-19 affects different animal species. We are aware of a very small number of pets, including dogs and cats, outside the United States reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus; it is the first confirmed case of COVID-19 infection in an animal in the United States.  </p>
<p>Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggest that dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based upon a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q: Since tigers can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, should I worry about my pet cat?","<div>
<p>A: The tiger infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 is the first case of its kind. We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. FDA is aware of a very small number of pets outside the United States, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19.</p>
<p>At this time, there is no evidence that pets, including cats and dogs, can spread COVID-19 to people. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.</p>
<p>People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Why are animals being tested when many people can’t get tested?,"<div>
<p>A: In the face of limited resources, animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances when it is necessary. Any decisions to test animals are made on a case-by-case basis by the state veterinarian in close consultation with the animal’s veterinarian. For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, has exposure, and other diseases have been ruled out, the animal’s veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.</p>
<p>While the animal and human tests are generally similar, this type of testing has to be adjusted in each species and for each sample type (blood, feces, nasal swab). The state and university laboratory animal tests were intentionally developed to use alternative testing supplies, where possible, to limit placing additional stresses on human testing resources, while also recognizing the potential importance of animal testing to supporting human and animal health.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Can pets carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?,"<div>
<p>A: Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.</p>
<p>However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/publications/stay-healthy-pets.html"">healthy habits</a> around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them and especially after cleaning up their waste.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Are there any approved products that can prevent or treat COVID-19 in animals?,"<div>
<p>A: No. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act, “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals” are drugs. The FDA has not approved any drugs for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of COVID-19 in animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) <a href=""https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/veterinary-biologics"">Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB)</a> regulates veterinary biologics, including vaccines, diagnostic kits, and other products of biological origin. Similarly, APHIS CVB has not licensed any products to treat or prevent COVID-19 in animals.</p>
<p>The FDA has taken action against unapproved products claiming to prevent or cure COVID-19. The public can help safeguard human and animal health by reporting any products claiming to do so to <a href=""mailto:FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov"">FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov</a> or 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332).</p>

"Q: Is it true that animals, like dogs, cats, and cattle, get their own different types of coronavirus?","<div>
<p>A: Yes. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses like COVID-19 cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. For example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. This vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent COVID-19 in cattle or other species, including humans.</p>
<p>Dogs can get a respiratory coronavirus, which is part of the complex of viruses and bacteria associated with canine infectious respiratory disease, commonly known as “kennel cough.” While this virus is highly contagious among both domestic and wild dogs, it is not transmitted to other animal species or humans.</p>
<p>Most strains of feline enteric coronavirus, a gastrointestinal form, are fought off by a cat’s immune system without causing disease. However, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that is almost always fatal.</p>
<p>Other species, like horses, turkeys, chickens, and swine, can contract their own species-specific strains of coronavirus but, like the other strains mentioned above, they are not known to be transmissible to humans. More information is available in the American Veterinary Medical Association’s <a href=""https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/AVMA-Coronavirus-Taxonomy-Notes.pdf"">fact sheet about coronaviruses in domestic species</a>.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q: If my pet previously had a species-specific coronavirus, does that make them more or less likely to get COVID-19?","<div>
<p>A: There are no data to suggest that current or previous infection with another strain of coronavirus would make your pet more or less likely to get COVID-19.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
"Q: If my pet has been vaccinated for species-specific coronavirus, does that make them more or less likely to get COVID-19?","<div>
<p>A: Species-specific coronavirus vaccines are unlikely to work against this type of coronavirus because it is a new virus that is different from the species-specific strains of coronavirus targeted by the vaccine.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: My pet has health problems and goes to the vet regularly for treatment. Should I be doing anything different to manage their health during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"<div>
<p>A: While you should not avoid necessary visits to your veterinarian due to the COVID-19 outbreak, you should exercise reasonable caution just like you would if you were going to any other public place. If you are concerned about your own health or that of your pet when going to the veterinarian, contact their office in advance to discuss any recommended precautions.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Is it safe to adopt pets from a shelter or rescue?,"<div>
<p>A: There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter or rescue pets, in the United States, might be a source of COVID-19.</p>
<p>
</p></div>"
Q: Are there going to be any animal drug shortages due to the COVID-19 outbreak?,"<div>
<p>A: The FDA has been and is continuing to closely monitor how the COVID-19 outbreak may impact the animal medical product supply chain.</p>
<p>We have been reaching out to manufacturers as part of our approach to identifying potential disruptions or shortages. We will use all available tools to react swiftly to help mitigate the impact if a potential disruption or shortage is identified.</p>
